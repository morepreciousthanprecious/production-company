								The first documentary by and about the kids of 9/11. Seventeen years after losing her father and two uncles on September 11th  Delaney Colaio-Coppola goes on an inspiring journey to unite with other surviving kids. As we follow Delaney on this unique journey of discovery, we find our subjects at different stages of dealing with grief. Upon exploring the diverse paths taken, both literally and figuratively, we ultimately discover that all roads do lead to hope. Benefitting Tuesday's Children, our film aims to be a tool for recovery and promises to inspire a renewed sense of hope and unity.

							Women Rising is the founding partner, director, and producer of ProtectHer.  With the belief that in order to safeguard the dorm rooms, we have to activate the influence of the locker rooms, ProtectHer is a first of its kind sexual assault prevention program targeting male athletes.  The four-part film anchored program in development is made up of a documentary style film and three shorter film pieces, all delivered with companion curriculum. The program will be available for license to schools and universities in Spring 2017 and  will be delivered via a protected, proprietary digital platform.

								Sara previously held positions in media and entertainment including Executive Director of Interactive Marketing at Paramount Pictures, VP of Digital Marketing at MGM Studios, and CEO and Co-Founder of NowLive which was acquired by Live Media Group in 2013.  During her experience in entertainment, she was told by her female boss, that she “belonged more in an apron than in an office.”  Recognizing that women have to champion each other rather than allow each other to feel threatened by each other, Sara founded Women Rising, which is dedicated to empowering women and girls through content and experiences.  After more than 10 years away in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, Sara returned to Austin for the opportunity as the Executive Producer for the first TEDxAustinWomen, which ultimately became the #1 viewed TEDxWomen event in the world across 58 countries.  After meeting Lizzie Velasquez during TEDxAustinWomen, Sara and Women Rising secured Lizzie’s rights to tell her story.  Sara’s directorial debut, "A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story”, broke Kickstarter records with its fundraising campaign becoming one of the site’s most successful crowdfunded documentaries of all time.   Sara then was hired by Conde Nast to produce and direct an original series, Lizzie’s Film, Everyone’s Story, for Glamour.com, and in 2016 returned to live experiences by producing, directing, and programming the R3 Summit for Prevention Magazine (Rodale Inc) and The Circular Summit, in partnership with Entrepreneur and Inc. magazines.  Sara is now directing and producing ProtectHer as well as executive producing the animated short documentary Tightly Wound.  Sara is a member of the Producer's Guild of America New Media Council, was selected to attend The White House Women Entrepreneurship Conference, The White House Champions for Change Summit, and the final White House’s It’s On Us summit, has been nominated twice for Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Entrepreneur, and has been featured in publications including Inc., Entrepreneur, Forbes, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, IndieWire, The Mighty, The Washington Post, and The New York Times.

								Since beginning her career back in 2004, Lisa has enjoyed improving the lives of others.  Born and raised in Austin, she began working at The Seton Fund raising funds, through personal solicitations and special events, for those in the community who were unable to afford healthcare.  She has worked at Children’s Medical Center Foundation fundraising for Dell Children’s Medical Center.  There she led the Employee Giving Campaign, coordinated multiple donor events and developed a Stewardship Program.  From there, Lisa worked in the Development Department at St. Michael’s Catholic Academy where she spent her time collaborating closely with both parents and students.  While there she developed and implemented an Annual Appeal process, raised funds through grant writing, assisted with the Capital Campaign and created an Annual Appeal Wall further thanking all donors.  In an organic transition to continue helping others, Lisa shifted her focus to empowering women.  In 2016 she joined Women Rising, a production company that creates content and experiences to empower women and girls.  Her particular skillset is constantly utilized in her capacity as Producer for the company, as well as Associate Producer on projects such as Tightly Wound and ProtectHer.
