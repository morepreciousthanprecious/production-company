							In partnership with Lionsgate, Imagine Entertainment, Women Rising and the director of The Spy Who Dumped Me , we are creating an opportunity for female storytellers to share meaningful, heartfelt, and hilarious stories with the world. Inspired by The Spy Who Dumped Me, a hilarious buddy comedy starring Mila Kunis and Kate KcKinnon and directed by Susanna Fogel, we are inviting female filmmakers to share their stories about enduring friendships - with lots of laughs! The winner will be chosen and rewarded $15,000 to create their next short film, a trip to Los Angeles for an influencer screening of The Spy Who Dumped Me and a meet and greet with the filmmakers.
