						Named by Inc. Magazine in 2016 as “One of the Most Innovative, Interesting, and Purpose-Driven Women Led Startups to Watch,” Women Rising is a production company that creates content and experiences to empower women and girls.  In 2013, Women Rising produced and programmed the first TEDxAustinWomen in partnership with the United Nations Foundation. The event became the #1 viewed TEDxWomen event of 2013 out of more than 220 events across 58 countries. In 2014, Women Rising directed and produced its first feature film with the documentary, “A BRAVE HEART: The Lizzie Velasquez Story.” The film’s production was funded via a Kickstarter campaign and became one of the site’s most successful crowdfunded documentary projects of all time. A BRAVE HEART premiered opening weekend of the 2015 South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival, went on to win 10 awards from 9 festivals, qualified for the Academy Award, secured domestic broadcast distribution with LifetimeTV as the cable network's first documentary acquisition, international broadcast distribution with National Geographic Channel, was selected as a film envoy for the U.S. Department of State's American Film Showcase, and was named a double honoree by the Webby Awards. In 2016, Women Rising returned to live experiences by producing and directing the award-winning R3 Summit from Prevention Magazine (Rodale Inc.) and The Circular Summit, the inaugural women’s entrepreneurship conference in partnership with Entrepreneur and Inc. magazines.  Women Rising is now directing and producing ProtectHer, a first of its kind film-based curriculum to prevent sexual assault on campuses by empowering male athletes, launching in Spring 2017.
