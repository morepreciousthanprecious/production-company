							Women Rising is the founding partner, director, and producer of ProtectHer.  With the belief that in order to safeguard the dorm rooms, we have to activate the influence of the locker rooms, ProtectHer is a first of its kind sexual assault prevention program targeting male athletes.  The four-part film anchored program in development is made up of a documentary style film and three shorter film pieces, all delivered with companion curriculum. The program will be available for license to schools and universities in Spring 2017 and  will be delivered via a protected, proprietary digital platform.
