									The first documentary by and about the Kids of 9/11. Nearly 16 years after losing her father and two uncles on September 11th, Delaney Colaio goes on an inspiring journey to unite with other surviving children. Alongside Delaney, we will hear their stories as we find our Kids at different stages of dealing with grief. Following their paths, literally and figuratively, we ultimately discover that all roads lead to hope. Benefitting Tuesday's Children, We Go Higher aims to be a resource for recovery for anyone dealing with loss and promises to inspire a renewed sense of hope and unity by empowering this group of Kids to become their own narrators.

								As producers of A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story, Women Rising oversaw every aspect of the film. Born with a rare syndrome that prevents her from gaining weight, Lizzie was bullied in school and online as she discovered a video labeling her “The Ugliest Woman in the World”. Lizzie's story proves that there is life on the other side of bullying and that self-worth and compassion are essential on that journey. With a world premiere at SXSW, the film went on to win 10 festival awards and qualified for the Academy Award, turning Lizzie into a national hero along the way.
